# React + TypeScript + Vite

Welcome to my homepage!

It was completely made by my cursor agent. Just to test it's capabilities.
I gotta say I'm pretty much impressed - it's going to be a great addition to my workflow. So far it's able to generate code, refactor, and even fix lint issues. Next time I'm going to use it to create something more complex - like a Next.js app.

Have a look around and let me know what you think.

## Linting
Run `npm run lint -- --fix` to fix lint issues.
Then test with `npm run lint`
